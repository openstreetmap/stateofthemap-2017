Wingu and TECHO are 2 NGOs that partnered to map 2432 slums nationwide and make the situation of 650685 visible to the public, government and academic institutions (http://relevamiento.techo.org.ar). Without OSM this couldn't have been done the way it was. OSM also makes visualizing all the data possible which aids governments (local, state and nation) make better decisions on how to use their budgets in the way that better impact the most people. In this talk I would like to talk how OSM and this project mutually benefited and talk about the 2 year process to reach the current online platform and what are the plans for it in the future.
