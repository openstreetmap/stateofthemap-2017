OpenStreetMap Carto is osm.org’s default stylesheet. This project is the most active and complex open source map style and where many contributors first learn how to make maps.

If you've ever wanted to
- contribute to the map style,
- start your own CartoCSS style,
- apply automation to map style development,
- manage a large open-source non-software project,
- understand the cartographic choices and pressures behind a complex map style, or
- know what changes are coming
this talk will answer your questions.
