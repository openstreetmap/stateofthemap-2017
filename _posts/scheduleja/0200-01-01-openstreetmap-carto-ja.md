OpenStreetMap Carto is osm.orgâ€™s default stylesheet. This project is the most active and complex open source map style and where many contributors first learn how to make maps.

If you've ever wanted to
- contribute to the map style,
- start your own CartoCSS style,
- apply automation to map style development,
- manage a large open-source non-software project,
- understand the cartographic choices and pressures behind a complex map style, or
- know what changes are coming
this talk will answer your questions.
