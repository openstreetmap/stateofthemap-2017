Live polling comes to State of the Map! Bring yourself and your phone for an interactive session of multiple choice questions. We start with a gentle one (Which editors do you use?) but after that it's up to you. Questions must be submitted in advance to the OSMF table. They must include a question and a choice of answers. Join in the poll from the room or from anywhere in the world - all you need is an internet connection and a phone or computer. Join at: [http://etc.ch/LaFP](http://etc.ch/LaFP)
