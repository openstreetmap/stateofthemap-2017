We developed an OpenStreetMap-driven smartphone application named "Daredemo Navi" for Kobe City's "Shiawase-no-Mura" (Village of Happiness) in Japan.
"Shiawase-no-Mura" is a comprehensive welfare complex equipped with a variety of integrated facilities designed to support independent living for the disabled and the elderly.
"UDNavi" is designed to support this clientele.

The turn-by-turn navigation with optional text-to-speech guidance supports both, the visually impaired as well as wheelchair users. Also the map design takes into account visually handicapped users and is easy-to-read for anyone with color blindness. 

This presentation will focus on technical and development aspects:
- How to write a routing function and build navigation texts with RoR and osm2pgrouting.
- How to customize Mapbox Vector Tiles with OpenMapTiles, and how to distribute both vector tiles and raster tiles with custom-designed style.
- How to support both iOS and Android with ReactNative WebView.
